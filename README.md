# Digital Commonplace

Formerly known as "The List", this is my Digital Commonplace. I came across the idea of a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) in an article about how Naveen [stays organized](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-naveen-keeps-track). My Digital Commonplace is a device for helping me remember knowledge and is unique to who I am. It's not intended to be *perfect*. It's an informal, living document filled with my own personal learnings and notes.

"It furthered suffered from the fact that all the methods had access to self, and therefore to the HTTP request object via self.request. This meant there was no clear separation of request processing from anything else — the layers had all merged.

Three ways to use UML: sketch, blueprint, and programming language
Most common: sketch
Blueprints or sketch: forward-engineering or reverse-engineering direction
"Forward engineering draws a UML diagram before you write code, while reverse engineering builds a UML diagram from existing code in order to help understand it."

Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the two most useful parts of the UML: class diagrams (core) and sequence diagrams

https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1244514791739109376 | Balaji S.
