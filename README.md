https://twitter.com/aaronchall/status/1010176883999281153 | Aaron Hall, 🐍 Professor, NYC, 🇺🇸 on Twitter: "My general principles for success: Overcome your weaknesses. Use your strengths. Both individually are necessary, but not sufficient. You must do both."

https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant/status/1031523746702606336 | Adam Grant on Twitter: "After reaching a goal, raising the bar often increases motivation but decreases happiness.

<!--
Three ways to use UML: sketch, blueprint, and programming language
Most common: sketch
Blueprints or sketch: forward-engineering or reverse-engineering direction
"Forward engineering draws a UML diagram before you write code, while reverse engineering builds a UML diagram from existing code in order to help understand it."

Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the two most useful parts of the UML: class diagrams (core) and sequence diagrams
