# Digital Commonplace

Formerly known as "The List", this is my Digital Commonplace. I came across the idea of a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) in an article about how Naveen [stays organized](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-naveen-keeps-track). My Digital Commonplace is a device for helping me remember knowledge and is unique to who I am. It's not intended to be *perfect*. It's an informal, living document filled with my own personal learnings and notes.

https://twitter.com/webology/status/1254798717196042241 | Jeff says, "wash your hands" 🧼 on Twitter: "If you are using GitHub Actions and wondering why this is useful? If you use `on: [pull_request, push]` (which I commonly see in docs) you are going spawn two test runs every time you push/update a pull request which is annoying. https://t.co/2fWPxHSjdA" / Twitter

<!--
Three ways to use UML: sketch, blueprint, and programming language
Most common: sketch
Blueprints or sketch: forward-engineering or reverse-engineering direction
"Forward engineering draws a UML diagram before you write code, while reverse engineering builds a UML diagram from existing code in order to help understand it."

Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the two most useful parts of the UML: class diagrams (core) and sequence diagrams
