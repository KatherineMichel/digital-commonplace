# Digital Commonplace

Formerly known as "The List", this is my Digital Commonplace. I came across the idea of a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) in an article about how Naveen [stays organized](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-naveen-keeps-track). My Digital Commonplace is a device for helping me remember knowledge and is unique to who I am. It's not intended to be *perfect*. It's an informal, living document filled with my own personal learnings and notes.

Three ways to use UML: sketch, blueprint, and programming language
Most common: sketch
Blueprints or sketch: forward-engineering or reverse-engineering direction
"Forward engineering draws a UML diagram before you write code, while reverse engineering builds a UML diagram from existing code in order to help understand it."
