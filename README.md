# Digital Commonplace

Formerly known as "The List", this is my Digital Commonplace. I came across the idea of a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) in an article about how Naveen [stays organized](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-naveen-keeps-track). My Digital Commonplace is a device for helping me remember knowledge and is unique to who I am. It's not intended to be *perfect*. It's an informal, living document filled with my own personal learnings and notes.

"It furthered suffered from the fact that all the methods had access to self, and therefore to the HTTP request object via self.request. This meant there was no clear separation of request processing from anything else — the layers had all merged. This happens very easily with classes like this, because you never have to explicitly pass the request parameter around to make it available, it’s implicitly available via self."

https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1262970529746612224 | Simon Willison on Twitter: "Activity Monitor on my Mac shows Python running 438.9% CPU (SHA256 hashing 40,000 files using 5 threads) so it's definitely running across multiple cores. And the program seems to complete about 4x faster. So if, like me, you've mostly avoided threads in Python give them a go!" / Twitter

Three ways to use UML: sketch, blueprint, and programming language
Most common: sketch
Blueprints or sketch: forward-engineering or reverse-engineering direction
"Forward engineering draws a UML diagram before you write code, while reverse engineering builds a UML diagram from existing code in order to help understand it."
