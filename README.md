# Digital Commonplace

Formerly known as "The List", this is my Digital Commonplace. I came across the idea of a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) in an article about how Naveen [stays organized](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-naveen-keeps-track). My Digital Commonplace is a device for helping me remember knowledge and is unique to who I am. It's not intended to be *perfect*. It's an informal, living document filled with my own personal learnings and notes.

Each of these is based upon jumps. Sequential statements jump from the end of the first to be beginning of the second."
https://twitter.com/_ericelliott/status/1067585128933851137 | Eric Elliott on Twitter: "In programmer lingo, algebras are abstractions made up of functions (operations) accompanied by specific laws enforced by unit tests those functions must pass (axioms/equations)."
https://twitter.com/vbhvsgr/status/1122901493877805058 | Vaibhav Sagar on Twitter: "a compiler is a function that turns a sequence into a tree, turns that tree into a graph, and then turns that graph back into a sequence"
