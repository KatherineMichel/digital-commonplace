# Digital Commonplace

Formerly known as "The List", this is my Digital Commonplace. I came across the idea of a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) in an article about how Naveen [stays organized](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-naveen-keeps-track). My Digital Commonplace is a device for helping me remember knowledge and is unique to who I am. It's not intended to be *perfect*. It's an informal, living document filled with my own personal learnings and notes.

Each of these is based upon jumps. Sequential statements jump from the end of the first to be beginning of the second."
https://twitter.com/_ericelliott/status/1067585128933851137 | Eric Elliott on Twitter: "In programmer lingo, algebras are abstractions made up of functions (operations) accompanied by specific laws enforced by unit tests those functions must pass (axioms/equations)."

* [Martin Fowler: UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language](https://www.amazon.com/UML-Distilled-Standard-Modeling-Language/dp/0321193687)

<!--
Three ways to use UML: sketch, blueprint, and programming language
Most common: sketch
Blueprints or sketch: forward-engineering or reverse-engineering direction
"Forward engineering draws a UML diagram before you write code, while reverse engineering builds a UML diagram from existing code in order to help understand it."

Agile Software Development (http://agileManifesto.org). Examples are Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, Feature Driven Development (FDD), Crystal, and DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method)
Patterns books: [Gang of Four], [POSA1], [POSA2], [Core J2EE Patterns], [Pont], and with suitable immodesty [Fowler, AP] and [Fowler, P of EAA]. Patterns home page: http://www.hillside.net/patterns.

Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the two most useful parts of the UML: class diagrams (core) and sequence diagrams

Chapter 5
class diagrams

Chapters 6 through 8
structure of a system: object diagrams, package diagrams, and deployment diagrams.

Chapters 9 through 11 
behavioral techniques: use cases, state diagrams (a.k.a. state machine diagrams), and activity diagrams
