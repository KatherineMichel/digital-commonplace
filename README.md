# Digital Commonplace

Formerly known as "The List", this is my Digital Commonplace. I came across the idea of a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) in an article about how Naveen [stays organized](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/how-naveen-keeps-track). My Digital Commonplace is a device for helping me remember knowledge and is unique to who I am. It's not intended to be *perfect*. It's an informal, living document filled with my own personal learnings and notes.

* [Martin Fowler: UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language](https://www.amazon.com/UML-Distilled-Standard-Modeling-Language/dp/0321193687)

<!--
Three ways to use UML: sketch, blueprint, and programming language
Most common: sketch
Blueprints or sketch: forward-engineering or reverse-engineering direction
"Forward engineering draws a UML diagram before you write code, while reverse engineering builds a UML diagram from existing code in order to help understand it."

Agile Software Development (http://agileManifesto.org). Examples are Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, Feature Driven Development (FDD), Crystal, and DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method)
Patterns books: [Gang of Four], [POSA1], [POSA2], [Core J2EE Patterns], [Pont], and with suitable immodesty [Fowler, AP] and [Fowler, P of EAA]. Patterns home page: http://www.hillside.net/patterns.

Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the two most useful parts of the UML: class diagrams (core) and sequence diagrams

Chapter 5
class diagrams

Chapters 6 through 8
structure of a system: object diagrams, package diagrams, and deployment diagrams.

Chapters 9 through 11 
behavioral techniques: use cases, state diagrams (a.k.a. state machine diagrams), and activity diagrams
