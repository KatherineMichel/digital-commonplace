Three ways to use UML: sketch, blueprint, and programming language
Most common: sketch
Blueprints or sketch: forward-engineering or reverse-engineering direction
"Forward engineering draws a UML diagram before you write code, while reverse engineering builds a UML diagram from existing code in order to help understand it."
