https://twitter.com/ploeh/status/1101442797436055552 | Mark Seemann on Twitter: "Software development productivity has little correlation to how fast you can produce code. It's closer related to the total cost of ownership of that code. Some code, you can write in one hour, and then proceed to waste days or months maintaining and troubleshooting."

* [Martin Fowler: UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language](https://www.amazon.com/UML-Distilled-Standard-Modeling-Language/dp/0321193687)

<!--
Three ways to use UML: sketch, blueprint, and programming language
Most common: sketch
Blueprints or sketch: forward-engineering or reverse-engineering direction
"Forward engineering draws a UML diagram before you write code, while reverse engineering builds a UML diagram from existing code in order to help understand it."

Chapters 3 and 4 discuss the two most useful parts of the UML: class diagrams (core) and sequence diagrams

Chapters 9 through 11
