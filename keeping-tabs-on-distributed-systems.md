Gossip Dissemination
Use a random selection of nodes to pass on information to ensure it reaches all the nodes in the cluster without flooding the network
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/gossip-dissemination.html

HeartBeat
Show a server is available by periodically sending a message to all the other servers.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/heartbeat.html

Lease
Use time-bound leases for cluster nodes to coordinate their activities.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/lease.html


## Clock

Clock-Bound Wait
Wait to cover the uncertainty in time across cluster nodes before reading and writing values so that values can be correctly ordered across cluster nodes.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/clock-bound-wait.html

Generation Clock
A monotonically increasing number indicating the generation of the server.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/generation-clock.html

Hybrid Clock
Use a combination of system timestamp and logical timestamp to have versions as date and time, which can be ordered
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/hybrid-clock.html

Lamport Clock
Use logical timestamps as a version for a value to allow ordering of values across servers
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/lamport-clock.html

## Consistency, Election, Quorum, Consensus Algorithm

Consistent Core
Maintain a smaller cluster providing stronger consistency to allow the large data cluster to coordinate server activities without implementing quorum-based algorithms.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/consistent-core.html

Emergent Leader
Order cluster nodes based on their age within the cluster to allow nodes to select a leader without running an explicit election.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/emergent-leader.html

Leader and Followers
Have a single server to coordinate replication across a set of servers.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/leader-follower.html

Majority Quorum
Avoid two groups of servers making independent decisions by requiring majority for taking every decision.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/majority-quorum.html

Paxos
Use two consensus building phases to reach safe consensus even when nodes disconnect
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/paxos.html

## Read Requests

Follower Reads
Serve read requests from followers to achieve better throughput and lower latency
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/follower-reads.html

## Requests

Idempotent Receiver
Identify requests from clients uniquely so you can ignore duplicate requests when client retries
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/idempotent-receiver.html

Request Batch
Combine multiple requests to optimally utilise the network
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/request-batch.html

Request Pipeline
Improve latency by sending multiple requests on the connection without waiting for the response of the previous requests.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/request-pipeline.html

Request Waiting List
Track client requests which require responses after the criteria to respond is met based on responses from other cluster nodes.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/request-waiting-list.html

Single-Socket Channel
Maintain the order of the requests sent to a server by using a single TCP connection
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/single-socket-channel.html

Singular Update Queue
Use a single thread to process requests asynchronously to maintain order without blocking the caller.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/singular-update-queue.html

## Updates

State Watch 
Notify clients when specific values change on the server
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/state-watch.html

Two-Phase Commit
Update resources on multiple nodes in one atomic operation
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/two-phase-commit.html | Two-Phase Commit

Version Vector 
Maintain a list of counters, one per cluster node, to detect concurrent updates

Versioned Value
Store every update to a value with a new version, to allow reading historical values.

## Partitions

Fixed Partitions
Keep the number of partitions fixed to keep the mapping of data to partition unchanged when the size of a cluster changes.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/fixed-partitions.html

Key-Range Partitions
Partition data in sorted key ranges to efficiently handle range queries.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/key-range-partitions.html

## Logs

Segmented Log
Split log into multiple smaller files instead of a single large file for easier operations.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/segmented-log.html

Write-Ahead Log
Provide durability guarantee without the storage data structures to be flushed to disk, by persisting every state change as a command to the append only log.

Replicated Log
Keep the state of multiple nodes synchronized by using a write-ahead log that is replicated to all the cluster nodes.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/replicated-log.html

High-Water Mark
An index in the write-ahead log showing the last successful replication.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/high-watermark.html

Low-Water Mark
An index in the write-ahead log showing which portion of the log can be discarded.
https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/low-watermark.html
