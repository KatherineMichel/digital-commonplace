https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf | VanRoyChapter.pdf
https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/paradigms.html | Classification of the principal programming paradigms
Programming concepts Section 4 explains the four most important concepts in programming: records, lexically scoped closures, independence (concurrency), and named
state.
Data abstraction Section 5 explains how to define new forms of data with their operations in a program. We show the four kinds of data abstractions: objects and abstract
data types are the two most popular, but there exist two others, declarative objects and
stateful abstract data types.

Gang of Four: Principles

Composition over Inheritance: https://python-patterns.guide/gang-of-four/composition-over-inheritance/
Problem: the subclass explosion
Solution #1: The Adapter Pattern
Solution #2: The Bridge Pattern
Solution #3: The Decorator Pattern
Solution #4: Beyond the Gang of Four patterns

* Dodge: “if” statements
* Dodge: Multiple Inheritance: https://fuhm.net/super-harmful/
* Dodge: Mixins
* Dodge: Building classes dynamically

<!--
Python-Specific Patterns

The Global Object Pattern
The Constant Pattern
Import-time computation
Dunder Constants
The Global Object Pattern
Global Objects that are mutable
Import-time I/O

The Prebound Method Pattern
Alternatives
The pattern
The Sentinel Object Pattern

Sentinel Value
The Null Pointer Pattern
The Null Object Pattern
Sentinel Objects

Gang of Four: Creational Patterns¶

The Abstract Factory Pattern
The Pythonic approach: callable factories
Restriction: outlaw passing callables
Restriction: outlaw passing classes
Generalizing: the complete Abstract Factory

The Builder Pattern
The Builder as convenience
Nuance
Dueling builders
A degenerate case: simulating optional arguments

The Factory Method Pattern
Dodge: use Dependency Injection
Instead: use a Class Attribute Factory
Instead: use an Instance Attribute Factory
Instance attributes override class attributes
Any callables accepted
Implementing

The Prototype Pattern
The problem
Pythonic solutions
Implementing

The Singleton Pattern
Disambiguation
The Gang of Four’s implementation
A more Pythonic implementation
Verdict

Gang of Four: Structural Patterns

The Composite Pattern
Example: the UNIX file system
On hierarchies
Example: GUI programming with Tkinter
Implementation: to inherit, or not?

The Decorator Pattern
Definition
Implementing: Static wrapper
Implementing: Tactical wrapper
Implementing: Dynamic wrapper
Caveat: Wrapping doesn’t actually work
Hack: Monkey-patch each object
Hack: Monkey-patch the class
Further Reading

The Flyweight Pattern
Factory or Constructor
Implementing

Gang of Four: Behavioral Patterns

The Iterator Pattern
Iterating with the “for” loop
The pattern: the iterable and its iterator
A twist: objects which are their own iterator
Implementing an Iterable and Iterator
Python’s extra level of indirection
