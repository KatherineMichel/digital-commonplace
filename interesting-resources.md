https://twitter.com/ploeh/status/1101442797436055552 | Mark Seemann on Twitter: "Software development productivity has little correlation to how fast you can produce code. It's closer related to the total cost of ownership of that code. Some code, you can write in one hour, and then proceed to waste days or months maintaining and troubleshooting."
