https://twitter.com/webology/status/1254091755026288640 | Jeff says, "wash your hands" 🧼 on Twitter: " If you are using GitHub Actions, here is a standard event trigger setup that I use for running a workflow on all pull requests and all git commits pushed to the master branch. I use it in almost every project I touch, and I see people confused by how to set it up. https://t.co/CMdKCHTyMT" / Twitter
https://twitter.com/webology/status/1254798717196042241 | Jeff says, "wash your hands" 🧼 on Twitter: "If you are using GitHub Actions and wondering why this is useful? If you use `on: [pull_request, push]` (which I commonly see in docs) you are going spawn two test runs every time you push/update a pull request which is annoying. https://t.co/2fWPxHSjdA" / Twitter
